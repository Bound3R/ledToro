# LEDTORO: Smart Notification Display Project

This project aims to create a **physichal device that displays automated messages**, such as reminders or daily notifications.
The idea is to use a **screen (LED, LCD, or eink)** connected to a simple app that receives and displays information in a simple way.

## üß† Objective

Develop a solution that allows:

* Sending automated messages or notifications to a display.
* Showing agenda reminders or daily activities.
* Maintaining a stable and easy-to-manage connection.

The exact hardware has not yet been defined, so this document describes the project in a **general and open** way.

## ‚öôÔ∏è General Concept

The system will be composed of:

1. **A physical device** (microcontroller, pc or phone).
2. **A display** (LED, LCD, or e-ink, depending on availability).
3. **Software** that receives messages and displays them automatically.

## üöÄ Initial Plan

1. **Select the base hardware**

   * Compatible display (model to be defined).
2. **Test connection and visualization**

   * Display static text (test message).
3. **Add update system**

   * API or service to receive new messages.
4. **Automate**

   * Messages update automatically based on time or schedule.
5. **Document**

   * Define components and final connections.

## üìÖ Next Steps

1. Decide which type of display will be used (LED, LCD, or e-ink).
2. Build the first prototype to show a static message.
3. Implement remote message sending.
4. Design a simple administration interface.
